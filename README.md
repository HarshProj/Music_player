## Approach

### 1. **Audio Playback with Howler.js**

Howler.js is used to manage audio playback in the app. Each song is loaded as an audio object and controlled through the `Howl` API provided by Howler.js, allowing seamless playback, pausing, volume adjustment, and skipping to the next song.

### 2. **State Management**

Reactâ€™s useState and useEffect hooks are utilized to manage the state of the app, such as the currently playing song, volume level, and playback status. The app updates dynamically as users interact with audio controls.

### 3. **UI/UX Design**

The interface is styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive, mobile-first experience. The design features clear and simple controls for users to navigate and control their music experience efficiently.

### 4. **Responsive Design**

Tailwind CSS makes it easy to build a responsive UI. The music player adjusts for various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience whether on a mobile device or desktop.
